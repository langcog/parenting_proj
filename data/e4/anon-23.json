I'm sure you'll learn some interesting things. :) It also made me think about this: One thing I realized as I went from childhood to young adulthood and beyond: Plenty of people who've never even held a baby or spent any time with children decide to have kids, and yet they assert/assume that childless people they encounter have less experience than they do b/c they aren't parents. Presumably they haven't heard about people who babysit every week throughout their childhoods, or are camp counselors for years, or are involved aunts/uncles/neighbors/teachers, etc.? Isn't that wild? Ah, people.
