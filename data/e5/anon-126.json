down, cross questions to eliminate ambiguity in other questions, restated questions in different ways or asked the same question from the opposing side.  Pretty good study, only bad comment is I have twins and there was no way to mark that, or indicate that the reason I put 2 years old was because I had twins and not a step child, which again if I am correct about the intent of the survey could impact the results as my point of view of how to respond and raise a child might have been different to the mothers and my responses were impacted in this way... Not sure if that matters though.  Also, results of the experiment and or study would be interesting to know, so it would be nice to have a place to put an email address to get see the results of the experiment, also to know if I was right about the intent.
