        <b>Learning about Toys</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Ours is an age of pedagogy. Anxious parents instruct their children more and more, at younger and younger ages, until they're reading books to babies in the womb. They pressure teachers to make kindergartens and nurseries more like schools. So does the law—the 2001 No Child Left Behind Act explicitly urged more direct instruction in federally funded preschools.
        <br>
        <br>
        There are skeptics, of course, including some parents, many preschool teachers, and even a few policy-makers. Shouldn't very young children be allowed to explore, inquire, play, and discover, they ask? Perhaps direct instruction can help children learn specific facts and skills, but what about curiosity and creativity—abilities that are even more important for learning in the long run?
        <br>
        <br>
        Developmental scientists like me explore the basic science of learning by designing controlled experiments. We might start by saying: Suppose we gave a group of 4-year-olds exactly the same problems and only varied on whether we taught them directly or encouraged them to figure it out for themselves? Would they learn different things and develop different solutions? 
        <br>
        <br>
       In one study, MIT professor Laura Schulz, her graduate student Elizabeth Bonawitz, and their colleagues looked at how 4-year-olds learned about a new toy with four tubes. Each tube could do something interesting: If you pulled on one tube it squeaked, if you looked inside another tube you found a hidden mirror, and so on. For one group of children, the experimenter said: "I just found this toy!" As she brought out the toy, she pulled the first tube, as if by accident, and it squeaked. She acted surprised ("Huh! Did you see that? Let me try to do that!") and pulled the tube again to make it squeak a second time. With the other children, the experimenter acted more like a teacher. She said, "I'm going to show you how my toy works. Watch this!" and deliberately made the tube squeak. Then she left both groups of children alone to play with the toy.
        <br>
        <br>
       All of the children pulled the first tube to make it squeak. The question was whether they would also learn about the other things the toy could do. The children from the first group played with the toy longer and discovered more of its "hidden" features than those in the second group. In other words, direct instruction made the children less curious and less likely to discover new information.
        <br>
        <br>
       This provides scientific support for the intuitions many teachers have had all along: Direct instruction really can limit young children's learning. Teaching is a very effective way to get children to learn something specific—this tube squeaks, say, or a squish then a press then a pull causes the music to play. But it also makes children less likely to discover unexpected information and to draw unexpected conclusions.
        <br>
        <br>
        Why might children behave this way? Adults often assume that most learning is the result of teaching and that exploratory, spontaneous learning is unusual. But actually, spontaneous learning is more fundamental. It's this kind of learning, in fact, that allows kids to learn from teachers in the first place. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Some researchers argue that learning from teachers first requires you to learn about teachers. For example, if you know how teachers work, you tend to assume that they are trying to be informative. When the teacher in the tube-toy experiment doesn't go looking for hidden features inside the tubes, the learner unconsciously thinks: "She's a teacher. If there were something interesting in there, she would have showed it to me." These assumptions lead children to narrow in, and to consider just the specific information a teacher provides. Without a teacher present, children look for a much wider range of information and consider a greater range of options.

        <b>Babies and Surprising Events</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Fans of “Got Your Nose” take note: Unexpected experiences that violate infants' innate knowledge of the world, like a ball appearing to roll through a solid wall, stimulate interest and help them figure out where to focus their learning efforts. The discovery not only shows that very young babies already have sophisticated expectations, but that the ones who experience surprises learn more efficiently than those who don't.
        <br>
        <br>
        “Our research shows these surprising events are special opportunities to learn,” said cognitive psychologist Aimee E. Stahl of Johns Hopkins University. “If there's a mismatch between what you predicted should happen and what you actually observed, that's a special opportunity to revise the knowledge that you have and learn something new.”
        <br>
        <br>
        To test the idea, Stahl and co-author Lisa Feigenson showed a group of 11-month-olds a series of expected and unexpected events. A ball or toy car, for example, rolled down an incline and was either stopped by a solid wall or appeared to pass through it. Similarly, a ball or car could roll into a gap in a track and fall to the ground, or it might appear to “magically” pass over it and keep going.
        <br>
        <br>
        When given a choice, the infants touched, explored and played with the objects that defied their expectations much more often than they selected those that had behaved normally. And like budding scientists, the infants tested those objects for the specific behavior that had surprised them. When a toy car appeared to pass through a wall, the infants banged it to be sure it was solid. When it appeared to roll over an open gap, they picked it up and dropped it to be sure it would fall.
        <br>
        <br>
        “It's really specific behavior, and it's remarkably sophisticated,” Stahl notes. “It's not that they just want to explore an object because it did something surprising. It's what we'd call hypothesis testing, like scientists do all the time, and babies seem to be doing the same thing. They are testing hypotheses to try and get an explanation for how that object behaved in a really strange way.” 
        <br>
        <br>
        The results appear to demonstrate that babies use surprising events to guide their cognitive growth in a world already awash with stimuli. “There's an overwhelming quantity of input in the environment,” Stahl says. “How does anybody, let alone a baby with comparably limited cognitive resources, figure out what they should pay attention to or learn about versus what they should ignore? I think our results show that the knowledge they are born with appears to guide what you should learn about or seek more information about in the future.”

        <b>The Island Rule</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Somewhere between 50 and 100 millennia ago, a humanlike species thrived on the Indonesian island of Flores. Like modern humans, members of this species — named Homo floresiensis, after their home — built stone tools, hunted prey, and may even have used fire. Unlike modern humans, they had small brains, large teeth, receding foreheads, and relatively large feet.
        They also stood at approximately three feet six inches tall.
        <br>
        <br>
        Why did Homo floresiensis — also known as “hobbits” — have such an unusually short stature? Some scientists believe it may be the result of a controversial theory known as island dwarfing, in which living on an island causes certain animals to shrink in size.
        <br>
        <br>
        Hominins aren’t the only animals thought to experience island dwarfing. Isolated on the tropical Flores, Homo floresiensis likely hunted animals such as small pygmy elephants for food. If you had roamed the Mediterranean island of Cyprus around 10,000 B.C., you may also have come across Hippopotamus minor, a species of dwarfed hippopotamuses that stood about two and a half feet tall and measured around four feet long. Or, if you had visited the island of Crete, you might have seen Mammuthus creticus, the Cretan dwarf mammoth, a species that stood a little over three feet tall.
        <br>
        <br>
        “Classic observations indicate that large animals tend to decrease in size when evolving in insularity, whereas small animals tend to increase,” said Aida Gomez-Robles, an anthropologist at George Washington University. Because island ecosystems typically have fewer predators than mainland ecosystems, she explained, larger animals may start to shrink, making it so they require fewer resources to survive. (Homo floresiensis’ smaller stature may have been advantageous for this reason.) By contrast, smaller animals get larger, making them more metabolically efficient, or better able to use fat as an energy source.
        <br>
        <br>
        Despite these examples, though, the island rule is hotly disputed. A 2007 paper from the Proceedings of the Royal Society, for instance, claimed that “there is no evidence for the existence of the island rule,” and that the patterns observed by past scientists were more nuanced than any universal rule would allow for. Instead, the authors argued, the size of island-dwelling species is determined by the particular components of each island’s ecosystem and the characteristics of the species in question.
        <br>
        <br>
        “The overall evidence is not as strong as it might appear when you first package it in a neat narrative,” said Matt Tocheri, a researcher at the Smithsonian Institution’s Human Origins Program. The same evolutionary processes that power the island rule, he continued, can also happen on the mainland whenever certain ecosystems become isolated from others.
        Even the origin of Homo floresiensis, one of the island rule’s most compelling pieces of evidence, is still not certain. Robles noted that while many scientists favor the hypothesis that Homo floresiensis evolved from the larger Homo erectus, shrinking once the species was isolated on an island, other theories propose that Homo floresiensis evolved from other hominins that were already small, such as Homo habilis, or from even more small and primitive Australopithecus-like hominins. After all, our human ancestors and relatives were much smaller than modern humans. It’s possible their short stature was typical of the time, rather than a product of their ecosystem.
        <br>
        <br>
        In other words, while there’s plenty of evidence that suggests some species change size on islands, it’s not yet enough to constitute a “rule.” This is especially true when it comes to the question of how island life affected our species’ distant relatives. “Knowing is generations away,” Tocheri said, adding that there’s still too much scientists don’t know about H. floresiensisto understand how they fit into the island-rule hypothesis. “We all want to have that narrative, but we also have to be honest that we may never have that narrative in our own lifetimes.”

        <b>The Peacock Begonia</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Roses are red but violets aren’t blue. They’re mostly violet. The peacock begonia, however, is blue—and not just a boring matte shade, but a shiny metallic one. Its leaves are typically dark green in color, but if you look at them from the right angle, they take on a metallic blue sheen. “It’s like green silk, shot through with a deep royal blue,” says Heather Whitney from the University of Bristol.
        <br>
        <br>
        And she thinks she knows why.
        <br>
        <br>
        Similar metallic colours are common in nature—you can find it in the wings of many butterflies, the bibs of pigeons, the feathers of peacocks, and the shells of jewel beetles. These body parts get their color not from pigments but from microscopic structures that are found in evenly spaced layers. As light hits each layer, some gets reflected and the rest pass through. Because of the regular gaps between the layers, the reflected beams amplify each other to produce exceptionally strong colors—at least, from certain viewing angles. This is called iridescence.
        <br>
        <br>
        Iridescence is less obvious among plants, but there are some stunning exceptions. The beautiful peacock moraea—a type of iris—has iridescent blue patches at the base of its white petals. The marble berry produces fruit that look like Christmas baubles and are among the shiniest biological materials known. And many flowers, as Whitney discovered earlier this year, use subtle iridescence as a signal to bees and other pollinating insects.
        <br>
        <br>
        It makes sense for flowers and fruits to be shiny, since their conspicuous colors might attract animals that spread pollen and seeds.  But the peacock begonia has iridescent leaves—and that’s much weirder. Leaves are all about collecting light, and iridescence is about reflecting it. And the peacock begonia doesn’t have a lot of light to spare—in the tropical Malaysian rainforests where it lives, it grows in the perpetual shadow of much taller trees. “It seemed absolutely barmy that these deep-shade plants would produce structures that reflect photosynthetically useful light,” says Whitney.
        <br>
        <br>
        To understand why, you need to peer inside the leaves. In a typical leaf, you’d see green, bean-shaped structures called chloroplasts. And if you looked inside these, you’d see sets of stacked discs that resemble piles of coins. These stacks are where photosynthesis takes place. But the begonia has modified its chloroplasts so that their stacks are highly ordered and precisely spaced—far more than usual. These modified structures are called iridoplasts, and they’re the source of the leaves’ iridescence. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Whitney’s colleagues Matthew Jacobs and Martin Lopez-Garcia simulated what happens to light when it enters the iridoplasts. They showed that blue light reflects away, as you’d expect. But they also found that the regularly spaced stacks also slow the passage of green light, and so absorb it more effectively. Compared to standard chloroplasts, the iridoplasts can harvest light 5 to 10 percent more effectively. That might allow the shade-dwelling begonia to eke out every last scrap of available light, and grow better in the shade.
        <br>
        <br>
        But why are the iridoplasts blue? Is that just a coincidence—an inadvertent consequence of evolving stacks that better absorb green light? “Sort of,” says Whitney. It seems that way for the peacock begonia, but there are other shade-growing plants that produce blue iridescence with other microscopic structures, which have nothing to do with chloroplasts. “There seems to be another reason why these shade plants converge on blue iridescence,” says Whitney.
        Perhaps, she ventures, the gentle shimmer makes the plants harder to spot, and so defends them from hungry animals. Hiding by shining seems counter-intuitive, but then again, so does gathering light by reflecting it.
