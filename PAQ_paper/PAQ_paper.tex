\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

In the following sections, we describe the process of generating scale
items and initial steps towards validating the scale. To construct the
scale, we followed a structured plan, generating items based on our
review of the literature on parenting attitudes and practices and then
using dimension reduction techniques to identify latent factors (i.e.,
implicit theories) driving people's responses (Clark \& Watson, 1995;
Furr, 2011; Simms, 2008). We then conducted a series of studies aimed at
estimating ecological validity for the scale. Specifically, we asked
whether people's parenting attitudes as assessed by the PAQ varied based
on demographic factors, whether people's attitudes were related to their
self-reported parenting behaviors, and whether attitudes mediated
people's understanding of and memory for new information about parenting
and child development.

\subsection{Item generation and dimension
reduction}\label{item-generation-and-dimension-reduction}

In an initial phase of scale construction, we generated 27 statements
that described various attitudes about parenting and child development
that we predicted parents might differ on. We selected these items based
on a literature review of previous parenting research, including
existing measures and theories such as the Knowledge of Infant
Development Inventory (KIDI, MacPhee, 2002), Baumrind's parenting
framework, and theories of attachment parenting (Jones, Cassidy, \&
Shaver, 2014). Critically, although the present scale is theoretically
related to existing frameworks, the present scale differs from them in
that parents are asked about their attitudes, rather than their
knowledge or behaviors. Items included in the initial set related to
parents' emotional and physical relationships with their children, their
beliefs about children's early learning, beliefs about children's
autonomy, and other topics.

We administered the initial scale to 250 adults on Amazon's Mechanical
Turk (Mturk). Participants used a 7-point Likert scale to report the
degree to which they agreed with each statement from 0 (Do not Agree) to
6 (Strongly Agree). We began by conducting exploratory factor analysis
(EFA) to assess the dimensionality of the scale. Based on the output of
a parallel analysis (Horn, 1965), we retained 5 factors in this initial
model. We subsequently dropped any items that had factor loadings less
than .40 on the relevant factor, as well as any items that had factor
loadings greater than .40 on another factor.

We repeated this process a total of 8 times. After several iterations,
the parallel analysis began returning 3 factors, so we retained 3
factors in subsequent factor analyses. The first factor appeared to
corresponded to a theory about affection and attachment and captured the
idea that emotionally close parent-child relationships are important for
development. The second factor corresponded to ideas around the
importance of fostering early learning. The third factor corresponded to
ideas around rules and respect, including children's autonomy and
behavioral control. We titled these factors Affection and Attachment
(AA), Early Learning (EL), and Rules and Respect (RR). Once we had
identified these categories, we dropped items belonging to each category
(based on factor loadings) if analyses revealed that Cronbach's alpha
for that category would be increased by dropping the item. We also added
new items that were theoretically consistent with the categories that
had emerged. Some items were rephrased such that half of the items in
each subscale were negatively worded to control for response sets (e.g.,
a tendency to rate all items highly, Simms, 2008).

\subsection{Final scale}\label{final-scale}

The final set of items comprising the three subscales is presented in
Table \ref{tab:items}. For the final sample, which consisted of 250
participants recruited on Mturk, Chronbach's alpha for the whole scale
was 0.90, for the AA subscale was 0.82, for the EL subscale was 0.83,
and for the RR subscale was 0.81. In sum, items within subscales are
highly correlated, but items across subscales are highly correlated as
well, which may reflect response biases to rate all items particularly
high or low.

We next examined the loadings of individual items onto the three factors
(Figure \ref{fig:loadings}). Items loaded onto the three factors roughly
consistent with our established subscales, although some items from the
AA subscale loaded onto both the AA and EL factors, and several items
from the EL subscale loaded more strongly onto the AA factor. Given the
partial overlap of the EL and AA factors, it is possible that
participants' responses on these items were driven to some extent by a
more general attitude towards more involved parenting.

Approaches to parenting are known to differ across cultures and groups.
To better understand whether the parenting attitudes captured by our
survey reflect group differences, we examined average scores on the PAQ
subscales based on demographic factors. We administered the PAQ to 680
parents who were members of a local children's museum and subsequently
asked them to provide information about their gender, level of
education, age, ethnicity, and the number of children they have. Figure
\ref{fig:demographics} displays the average PAQ scores for each
demographic category.

To quantify any possible group differences, we fit separate Bayesian
mixed-effects ordinal regression models for each subscale (AA, EL, RR)
with the following structure, with likert ratings of agreement for each
item (1-6) entered as dependent measures:
\texttt{agreement\ rating\ \textasciitilde{}\ age\ +\ education\ +\ ethnicity\ +\ gender\ +\ number\ of\ children\ +\ (1\ \textbar{}\ subject)\ +\ (1\textbar{}\ item)}
Groups with fewer than 20 cases were removed from plots and analyses to
avoid overfitting. Although displayed as categorical for visual
simplicity in Figure \ref{fig:demographics}, parent age and education in
years were entered as continuous variables in the regression models.

Table \ref{tab:demo} displays the results of the regression analyses. We
found that stronger agreement with AA attitudes was associated with
identifying as Hispanic or Latino (\(\beta\) = 0.72, 95\% CI = 0.34 -
1.11), White (\(\beta\) = 0.31, 95\% CI = 0.12 - 0.49), or multiple
ethnicities (\(\beta\) = 0.50, 95\% CI = 0.18 - 0.82) compared to Asian
(the comparison level). Having a greater number of children was
associated with lower agreement with AA attitudes (\(\beta\) = -0.14,
95\% CI = -0.24 - -0.03), as was identifying as Male (\(\beta\) = -0.70,
95\% CI = -0.92 - -0.48). Parent education was not meaningfully
associated with AA scores.

We found that stronger agreement with EL scores was associated with
identifying as White (\(\beta\) = 0.44, 95\% CI = 0.25 - 0.62) or
multiple ethnicities (\(\beta\) = 0.56, 95\% CI = 0.22 - 0.90), and
having more children was associated with slightly lower agreement with
EL scores (\(\beta\) = -0.14, 95\% CI = -0.24 - -0.03). No other
demographic variables were related to EL scores.

Finally, we found that stronger agreement with RR attitudes was
associated with having a greater number of children (\(\beta\) = 0.15,
95\% CI = 0.04 - 0.25), and identifying as White was associated with
lower agreement with RR attitudes (\(\beta\) = -0.20, 95\% CI = -0.38 -
-0.01).

Another way of assessing the ecological validity of the PAQ is to ask
whether the parenting attitudes it measures are related to actual
parenting behaviors. For example, do parents who strongly agree with
items on the Early Learning subscale read to their children more often?
Do parents who strongly endorse items on the Rules and Respect subscale
give more time-outs? To assess this, we asked a sample of 250 parents on
Mturk to complete the PAQ and then rate the frequency with which they
engaged in a number of parenting behaviors, focusing on the prior month
(Table \ref{tab:behavesents}). We elicited responses about 12 different
behaviors, with four corresponding to each PAQ category. Parents chose
between the following frequency options: \enquote{Multiple times per
day}, \enquote{Most days}, \enquote{Once or twice per week,}
\enquote{Occasionally,} \enquote{Almost never,} \enquote{Never,} and
\enquote{My child is too young for this.} Parents who did not have
children under the age of 5 were excluded from analyses, as were any
responses of \enquote{My child is too young for this.}

The distribution of frequencies that parents reported is displayed in
Figure \ref{fig:behavefreq}. To assess whether parenting behaviors are
associated with parenting attitudes, we calculated participants' average
PAQ subscale scores and fit separate bayesian ordinal logistic
mixed-effects regressions for the three cateogories of behaviors with
the following structure:
\texttt{behavior\ frequency\ \textasciitilde{}\ AA\ PAQ\ score\ +\ EL\ PAQ\ score\ +\ RR\ PAQ\ score\ +\ child\ age\ +\ (1\ \textbar{}\ subject)\ +\ (1\textbar{}\ item)}
(Table \ref{tab:behavetab}). The relation between PAQ scores and
behavior frequencies are presented in Figure \ref{fig:behavepaq}.

We found that the frequency of AA behaviors was positively associated
with AA attitudes (\(\beta\) = 0.81, 95\% CI = 0.53 - 1.12), but not RR
or EL attitudes or child age. Frequency of EL behaviors was positively
associated with stronger agreement with both AA (\(\beta\) = 0.37, 95\%
CI = 0.02 - 0.71) and EL attitudes (\(\beta\) = 0.52, 95\% CI = 0.18 -
0.88). The frequency of RR behaviors was positively associated with
stronger RR attitudes (\(\beta\) = 0.34, 95\% CI = 0.05 - 0.63), and to
a lesser extent, child age (\(\beta\) = 0.03, 95\% CI = 0.01 - 0.05).

These results suggest that parenting attitudes as assessed by the PAQ
have a meaningful relation to the actual behaviors parents engage in
with their children. This suggests that the current scale taps firmly
held beliefs that drive parents' decisions and behavior. It also
suggests that intervening on these beliefs may be an effective way of
promoting behavior change in parents, for example, to promote
opportunities for early learning. However, it is important to consider
that the present data are correlational and based on self-report. For
example, it is possible that participants' self-reported behaviors
capture their intentions rather than their actual behaviors, which would
likely be highly correlated with their self-reported attitudes. Future
work utilizing an intervention approach, and/or a diary method of
self-report, would help distinguish these possibilities.

\subsection{Study 3: Memory for new information about parenting and
child
development}\label{study-3-memory-for-new-information-about-parenting-and-child-development}

Parents' attitudes about parenting and child development may be an
important consideration for crafting interventions on parenting
behaviors or beliefs. There are frequent efforts to intervene on
parenting practices, for example, public service announcements telling
parents to read to their children; courses aimed at helping fathers
engage with their children; messages aimed at encouraging parents and
teachers to give children opportunities for free play. There is evidence
that existing lay theories can interact in surprising ways with this
type of messaging in other domains. Here we asked whether parents'
attitudes about parenting and child development would predict how they
uptake new information about child development versus an unrelated
topic.

Factor & Estimate & Est. Error & Lower 95\% CI & Upper 95\% CI \\ 
  \hline

  AA PAQ score & 0.05 & 0.15 & -0.25 & 0.35 \\ 
  RR PAQ score & -0.21 & 0.11 & -0.42 & 0.01 \\ 
  EL PAQ score & 0.82 & 0.16 & 0.52 & 1.14 \\ 
  AA PAQ score * EL Articles & 0.42 & 0.16 & 0.11 & 0.73 \\

  EL PAQ score * EL Articles & -0.27 & 0.16 & -0.58 & 0.05 \\

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

We asked 250 adults on Mturk to fill out the PAQ and then read four
popular press articles, two of which related to child development
({\textbf{???}}) and two of which related to other science topics
({\textbf{???}}). The articles were edited for length, and the order in
which the articles were presented was randomized. Next, participants
answered six four-alternative forced-choice questions testing their
memory and understanding of each article (24 total questions). We were
specifically interested in whether participants who agreed more strongly
with EL attitudes would better understand and remember the information
in the child development articles, which we predicted may have been
consistent with their existing views of development. Participants'
accuracy in relation to their average AA, EL and RR scores is displayed
in Figure \ref{fig:uptake}.

The average accuracy for control questions was 0.76(CI = 0.73 - 0.78)
and the average accuracy for experimenter questions was 0.81(CI = 0.73 -
0.83). There was no significant difference in accuracy between
conditions, t = -4.83, p = 0.00.

To assess whether participants who more strongly agreed with EL
attitudes were at an advantage for understanding and remembering the
child development articles they read, we fit a bayesian logistic
mixed-effects regression with the following structure:
\texttt{accuracy\ \textasciitilde{}\ AA\ PAQ\ score\ *\ article\ type\ +\ EL\ PAQ\ score\ *\ article\ type\ +\ RR\ PAQ\ score\ *\ article\ type\ +\ (article\ type\ \textbar{}\ subject)\ +\ (1\textbar{}\ item)}.
We excluded 7.70\% of responses from analyses because participants spent
fewer than 15 seconds reading the article, our pre-determined minimum
reading time.

We found that participants who agreed more strongly with EL attitudes
were more likely to answer memory questions correctly overall (\(\beta\)
= 0.82, 95\% CI = 0.52 - 1.14), but there was no interaction between EL
scores and article type, meaning that there was no advantage for people
with higher EL scores for understanding child development content in
particular. However, unexpectedly, there was an interaction between AA
attitudes and article type (\(\beta\) = 0.42, 95\% CI = 0.11 - 0.73),
such that people with stronger AA attitudes performed better on
questions about child development articles compared to control articles.
Rules and Respect attitudes did not predict memory for the articles.

In sum, our results suggest that people who believe more strongly in the
importance of early learning (i.e., those with higher EL PAQ scores) are
more likely to understand and recall details from science articles, but
they do not have a specific advantage for science articles related to
cognitive development during infancy. Contrary to our predictions, we
did find that people with higher AA scores had a specific advantage for
remembering the EL articles compared to control articles. Although the
present data cannot speak to why this might be, one possibility is that
people with higher AA scores have a stronger orientation towards content
about early childhood (compared to the unrelated content in the control
article) in general. These results could also reflect the fact that EL
and AA attitudes may overlap somewhat, as suggested by their respective
factor loadings, at least in the population we sampled for these
analyses.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

In the present work, we established a new scale to measure people's
attitudes about parenting and child development in three categories:
Rules and Respect, Affection and Attachment, and Early Learning. These
subscales are meant to capture meaningful differences in how people view
child development and the relative importance of different parenting
behaviors. We subjected our new scale to psychometric evaluation, and
found acceptably high correlations among subscale items, as well as the
predicted factor structure across subscales. In addition, we found
meaningful differences in attitudes across demographic groups and we
observed the expected relations between parenting attitudes and
behaviors. We also found that PAQ subscale scores predicted
understanding and memory for new information in science articles, though
not in the predicted patterns, as people with higher AA scores had an
advantage for remembering the content of EL articles, but not people
with higher EL scores.

In sum, this work provides initial evidence that meaningful differences
in adults' attitudes about child development and parenting can be
assessed by our new scale.

Although the present studies provide initial evidence for the
reliability and validity of our parenting measure among the population
we sampled, which was predominantly White and highly educated, further
evidence across a broader range of participants would provide additional
support for the scale. In addition, future work should target predictive
validity by determining whether subscale scores differentially predict
parents observable behaviors with their children, such as the quality of
conversations they engage their child in.

Implicit theories are a powerful driver of human behavior. Sometimes,
the interaction between interventions and their subjects' underlying
beliefs can produce powerful, non-linear results ({\textbf{???}}). Thus,
given both the variability in attitudes towards parenting across
cultures and the importance of improving parenting outcomes, it behooves
us to understand implicit theories of parenting. The current work takes
a first step in this direction.
