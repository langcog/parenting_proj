        Ours is an age of pedagogy. Anxious parents instruct their children more and more, at younger and younger ages, until they're reading books to babies in the womb. They pressure teachers to make kindergartens and nurseries more like schools. So does the law—the 2001 No Child Left Behind Act explicitly urged more direct instruction in federally funded preschools.
        <br>
        <br>
        There are skeptics, of course, including some parents, many preschool teachers, and even a few policy-makers. Shouldn't very young children be allowed to explore, inquire, play, and discover, they ask? Perhaps direct instruction can help children learn specific facts and skills, but what about curiosity and creativity—abilities that are even more important for learning in the long run?
        <br>
        <br>
        Developmental scientists like me explore the basic science of learning by designing controlled experiments. We might start by saying: Suppose we gave a group of 4-year-olds exactly the same problems and only varied on whether we taught them directly or encouraged them to figure it out for themselves? Would they learn different things and develop different solutions? 
        <br>
        <br>
       In one study, MIT professor Laura Schulz, her graduate student Elizabeth Bonawitz, and their colleagues looked at how 4-year-olds learned about a new toy with four tubes. Each tube could do something interesting: If you pulled on one tube it squeaked, if you looked inside another tube you found a hidden mirror, and so on. For one group of children, the experimenter said: "I just found this toy!" As she brought out the toy, she pulled the first tube, as if by accident, and it squeaked. She acted surprised ("Huh! Did you see that? Let me try to do that!") and pulled the tube again to make it squeak a second time. With the other children, the experimenter acted more like a teacher. She said, "I'm going to show you how my toy works. Watch this!" and deliberately made the tube squeak. Then she left both groups of children alone to play with the toy.
        <br>
        <br>
       All of the children pulled the first tube to make it squeak. The question was whether they would also learn about the other things the toy could do. The children from the first group played with the toy longer and discovered more of its "hidden" features than those in the second group. In other words, direct instruction made the children less curious and less likely to discover new information.
        <br>
        <br>
       This provides scientific support for the intuitions many teachers have had all along: Direct instruction really can limit young children's learning. Teaching is a very effective way to get children to learn something specific—this tube squeaks, say, or a squish then a press then a pull causes the music to play. But it also makes children less likely to discover unexpected information and to draw unexpected conclusions.
        <br>
        <br>
        Why might children behave this way? Adults often assume that most learning is the result of teaching and that exploratory, spontaneous learning is unusual. But actually, spontaneous learning is more fundamental. It's this kind of learning, in fact, that allows kids to learn from teachers in the first place. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Some researchers argue that learning from teachers first requires you to learn about teachers. For example, if you know how teachers work, you tend to assume that they are trying to be informative. When the teacher in the tube-toy experiment doesn't go looking for hidden features inside the tubes, the learner unconsciously thinks: "She's a teacher. If there were something interesting in there, she would have showed it to me." These assumptions lead children to narrow in, and to consider just the specific information a teacher provides. Without a teacher present, children look for a much wider range of information and consider a greater range of options.

        The first time a baby reaches for an object isn’t on most parents’ checklist of significant, or even particularly adorable, milestones. But a new study suggests that the act of reaching is a crucial part of a child’s development that, when mastered early, can lead to better motor skills, attention spans, and even vocabularies later on.
        <br>
        <br>
        Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh were interested in the effects of different types of reach-training on infants’ development. They instructed 25 mothers of three-month-olds to engage with their children on reach-related activities for ten minutes a day over the course of two weeks. Some of the mothers were given Velcro mittens for the babies to wear, as well as Velcroed toys for them to grab. The remaining mothers were also given mittens and toys, but without the Velcro. The children who wore the Velcro mittens were more likely to establish contact, whether accidentally or on purpose, with the toys. This, the researchers hypothesized, created an incentive for them to continue reaching.  
        <br>
        <br>
        When the children reached 15 months, the researchers recorded them playing with a bead-maze toy and used a frame-by-frame coding software to track the children’s visual and physical engagement with it. They also had parents filled out a survey in which they rated their child’s temperament. They discovered that the babies who had done the reach-training with the Velcro mittens and toys had more advanced motor skills and longer attention spans than those who did not, after researchers accounted for any differences in grasping abilities before the training. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Psychologists call these types of results a “developmental cascade,” meaning that the early adoption of one skill can lead to the learning of a number of other skills and therefore affect the child’s overall long-term development. In this case, the act of reaching teaches children to focus and interact with world around her or him. That interaction can lead to more verbal attention from her or his parents, which is crucial for language development.

        Fans of “Got Your Nose” take note: Unexpected experiences that violate infants' innate knowledge of the world, like a ball appearing to roll through a solid wall, stimulate interest and help them figure out where to focus their learning efforts. The discovery not only shows that very young babies already have sophisticated expectations, but that the ones who experience surprises learn more efficiently than those who don't.
        <br>
        <br>
        “Our research shows these surprising events are special opportunities to learn,” said cognitive psychologist Aimee E. Stahl of Johns Hopkins University. “If there's a mismatch between what you predicted should happen and what you actually observed, that's a special opportunity to revise the knowledge that you have and learn something new.”
        <br>
        <br>
        To test the idea, Stahl and co-author Lisa Feigenson showed a group of 11-month-olds a series of expected and unexpected events. A ball or toy car, for example, rolled down an incline and was either stopped by a solid wall or appeared to pass through it. Similarly, a ball or car could roll into a gap in a track and fall to the ground, or it might appear to “magically” pass over it and keep going.
        <br>
        <br>
        When given a choice, the infants touched, explored and played with the objects that defied their expectations much more often than they selected those that had behaved normally. And like budding scientists, the infants tested those objects for the specific behavior that had surprised them. When a toy car appeared to pass through a wall, the infants banged it to be sure it was solid. When it appeared to roll over an open gap, they picked it up and dropped it to be sure it would fall.
        <br>
        <br>
        “It's really specific behavior, and it's remarkably sophisticated,” Stahl notes. “It's not that they just want to explore an object because it did something surprising. It's what we'd call hypothesis testing, like scientists do all the time, and babies seem to be doing the same thing. They are testing hypotheses to try and get an explanation for how that object behaved in a really strange way.”
        <br>
        <br>
        The results appear to demonstrate that babies use surprising events to guide their cognitive growth in a world already awash with stimuli. “There's an overwhelming quantity of input in the environment,” Stahl says. “How does anybody, let alone a baby with comparably limited cognitive resources, figure out what they should pay attention to or learn about versus what they should ignore? I think our results show that the knowledge they are born with appears to guide what you should learn about or seek more information about in the future.”
