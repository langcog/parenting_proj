# parenting_proj

Studying parenting attitudes and beliefs. Initial study of parent attitudes/beliefs. Goal of creating a stable measure to use as both an outcome and mediator variable for parenting intervention studies. 

# Experiment 1

* Pilot A/B 10/29
* 44 questions adapted from Suskind et al. (2015) and Schulz, Muentner, & Magid CDS presentation
* basically no demographic questions
* first pilot to look at consistency in responding etc. 

# Experiment 2

* 11-16-15
* Questionnaire separated into two scales: Attitudes (27 items; based on Schulz) and Knowledge (27 items; based on Suskind)
* Attitudes run with Likert scale, Knowledge run with 2afc
* Added subscales to Attitudes scale a priori corresponding to:
  - Baumrind model (Authoritarian/Authoritative/Permissive)
  - Socio-emotional
* Removed outlier item from e1 (related to babies' expectations)
* Removed "babies learning from surprise" item from Freudian scale
* Added 2 items to rationalist scale
* Added MacArthur SES ladder
* Note, children question always returned yes due to bug in this run.

# Experiment 3
* 11-20-15
* Removed Knowledge scale
* Removed 1 item from Attitudes scale- unsupervised play
* Included additional demographic info- education, gender, age group

#Experiment 4
* 12-16-15
* Restructured and re-wrote items to correspond to 3 scales: Rules and Respect, Responsiveness and Affection, Active Learning
* 24 items (8 per scale)
* 2 items per scale are negatively worded
* Added demographic questions: # and ages of children; ethnicity and race

#Experiment 5
* 12-17-15
* Same as Experiment 4, with 2afc instead of Likert
* Included knowledge questions for comparison
* Knowledge questions came after attitudes questions so attitudes can be compared across Experiments 4 and 5 (Likert vs. 2afc)

#Experiment 6
* 1-8-16
* Added additional items to all scales, removed items that had low correlations with subscales in e4. 
* Re-anchored scale from Do not Agree- Agree Somewhat - Completely Agree
