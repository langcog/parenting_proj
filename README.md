#Early Parenting Attitudes Questionnaire 

A series of studies to create a new measure of intuitive theories about parenting and child development. We conducted a series of studies to estimate the validity of the new scale, asking whether the predicted factor structure emerged from subsequent confirmatory factor analysis on a new sample, whether agreement with each subscale varied based on demographic factors, whether intuitive theories predicted self-reported parenting behaviors, and whether theories predicted memory for new theory-consistent information.
